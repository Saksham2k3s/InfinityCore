### Challenges

**1 Making it Look Good Everywhere:**

I had to make sure the webpage looks nice on all kinds of devices, like phones and computers. This meant testing a lot to be sure everyone gets a good experience.

**2 Scrolling That Feels Nice:**

I wanted the scrolling on the webpage to feel smooth when you move up and down. Getting that just right took some experimenting to find the best way.

**3 Fun Search Bar:**

I added a cool search bar that not only looks good but also works well. Making it just right needed me to pay close attention to the details and put in some extra effort.

**4 Navbar for Small Screens:**

Creating a menu for smaller screens, like on your phone, was a bit tricky. I had to solve some puzzles to make sure it looks and works great on those tinier screens.
